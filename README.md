# Task-1-Calculator

This task has 2 files for you to look at.
Calculator.java, and Calculator2.java

The first one is a demo code to look at how classes and methods work.
It does basic mathematical functions, and can calculate the area of a circle.
Feel free to play around with it.

The main task is on Calculator2.java.
You have to make methods to do the quadratic formula (Search on the internet, like BBC Bitesize, if you are unaware of this)
The task is broken down into smaller methods. Each one is a step to do the formula such as squaring b, 4AC, square root 4AC
At the bottom there are methods for positive and a negative answer, so put + - respectively.
To help the final method is called 'quadraticFormula' - just call the positive and negative answer methods to print the results out.
