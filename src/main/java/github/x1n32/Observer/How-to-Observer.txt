For this Demo, we have 3 classes:
1. StreamingSite.java
2. Subscriber.java
3. Channel.java

An observer pattern is useful for when we want to notify changes.
We have an observer and an observable.

If we take a Streaming Site as an analogy:
 we have people who make content, called Channel (observable)
 and the people who watch their content, Subscriber (observers)

Subscribers want to know when a new video gets released
and the Channel wants to let everyone know that they released a new video.

Subscribers have a function called "update()"
The Channel calls this update when they 'upload' a video 
Not everyone gets this alert, as only the ones who subscribed to their specific channel gets alerted.

StreamingSite.java is to show how to run the program.
